# printf42prov

                                                  --- My own version of ft_printf ---

I wanted to follow the idea of having a buffer if size BUSIZ often defined in the system (used indeed in stevbuf)

That was quite a challenge but I've learned a lot about memory use, system optimizations and the different sizes we can use.

It's really far from perfect, and the code is hard to understand (and for now I really don't want to look at it again), especially because in the end I had to correct some details and add some functions in some files that hadn't 5 functions already... Thanks to the 42 norm

In the end, I'd recommand this project to no one, every one goes crazy on it, me included.

Used testers in additions of my own ones : 42TESTERS-PRINTF (Mazoise) - pft (galvinfielder) - PFT or pft_2019 (cclaude42) - PrintfTester (Tripouille)

                                                      Thank you to them ＼(´∀｀ )／
